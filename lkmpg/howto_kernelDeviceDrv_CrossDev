You're correct ‚Äî **Debian 11 (Bullseye)** only officially supports **GCC 10** in its default repositories, and installing GCC 12 is not straightforward without backports or external sources.

---

## ‚úÖ Best Option in Your Case

Since you're on Bullseye and already successfully **cross-compiled the RT kernel on your Bookworm host (Debian 12)**, you should **also cross-compile the kernel module on the host using the same environment/toolchain**.

This avoids all GCC version conflicts and guarantees compatibility.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Cross-Compile the Kernel Module on the Host

On your **Debian 12 (Bookworm)** host:

```bash
mkdir LEDline_tmp
ide kell masilni a Makefile-t
es a 74hct164.c-t


# Cross-compile the kernel module
make -C ~/rpi-kernel-rt \
  ARCH=arm64 \
  CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- \
  M=$(pwd) \
  modules
```

> Make sure `~/rpi-kernel-rt` is the kernel **build output** directory used when building the RT kernel for Raspberry Pi.

After building, you‚Äôll get a `.ko` file in the same directory. Example:

```bash
ls 74hct164.ko
```

---

### üöö Then, copy the `.ko` module to your Raspberry Pi:

On the Pi:

```bash
scp user@host:~/ballonwheel/lkmpg/LEDline/74hct164.ko .
sudo insmod ./74hct164.ko
```

Or if it needs to be installed persistently:

```bash
sudo cp 74hct164.ko /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/extra/
sudo depmod
sudo modprobe 74hct164
```

---

Let me know if you want a `Makefile` template for cross-compiling modules that matches this setup.



tha means i have a possibility for developing kerrnel device drive on cross platform on host



Yes ‚Äî **absolutely!** ‚úÖ You **can and should** develop your **kernel device driver on your host machine (cross-platform)** ‚Äî this is actually **best practice** for embedded Linux development.

---

### ‚úÖ Why Cross-Platform (Host-Based) Kernel Module Development Works Well

* üß† **Same toolchain**: If your host uses the **same GCC version** and cross-compiler (`aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc`) as you used to build the kernel, everything will match perfectly.
* üñ•Ô∏è **Faster build times**: Your host is way faster than the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.
* üß™ **Safer dev loop**: You avoid the risk of crashing or slowing down your target (Pi) during development.
* üí° **Flexible debugging**: You can even use `qemu`, test modules in isolation, or stage installation on SD card.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Minimum Requirements

1. **Cross-compiler toolchain on host**:

   * Use the same toolchain as when you built your RT kernel:

     ```bash
     sudo apt install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu
     ```

2. **Kernel build tree used during your RT kernel build**:

   * You need this on the host to build modules against the kernel's `.config`, headers, and symbols.

3. **Correct `Makefile`** for your module (example below).

---

### üìÑ Example Makefile for Cross-Building a Kernel Module

```makefile
obj-m := 74hct164.o

KDIR := /home/imre/rpi-kernel-rt
CROSS_COMPILE := aarch64-linux-gnu-
ARCH := arm64

all:
	make -C $(KDIR) M=$(PWD) ARCH=$(ARCH) CROSS_COMPILE=$(CROSS_COMPILE) modules

clean:
	make -C $(KDIR) M=$(PWD) clean
```

---

### üöö After Building

Once you have the `.ko` file:

* Copy it to the Pi using `scp`
* Or mount the SD card and place it directly
* Use `insmod`, `modprobe`, or stage it in `/lib/modules/.../extra/` and run `depmod`

---

### üß† Bonus Tip

If you expect to develop drivers long-term:

* You can also set up an **NFS root** and deploy/test modules live over network
* Or use **QEMU with kernel emulation**, for automation or CI

---

Let me know if you want to automate this build+deploy pipeline ‚Äî very doable.


****************************
You're on the right track. Here's **what should happen next**, and how to verify each step:

---

## ‚úÖ 1. **Copy the Kernel Module to the Target (Raspberry Pi)**

If you're on your host machine and want to copy to the Pi:

```bash
scp ~/ballonwheel/lkmpg/LEDline/74hct164.ko imre@raspberrypiZ2w3.local:~
```

Or from Pi if copying from host:

```bash
scp imre@host_ip:~/ballonwheel/lkmpg/LEDline/74hct164.ko .
```

---

## ‚úÖ 2. **Insert the Kernel Module on Raspberry Pi**

```bash
sudo insmod ./74hct164.ko
```

If successful, this command should return silently (no output = good news).

---

## ‚úÖ 3. **Verify That the Module Was Loaded**

```bash
lsmod | grep 74hct164
```

You should see something like:

```
74hct164             16384  0
```

Also check the kernel logs:

```bash
dmesg | tail -n 20
```

You should see logs from `printk()` in your module's `init` function.

---

## ‚úÖ 4. **(Optional) Create Device Node**

If your driver registers a character device (via `cdev_add`), create a node manually (replace `major` with your device‚Äôs major number):

```bash
sudo mknod /dev/shiftreg c <major> 0
sudo chmod 666 /dev/shiftreg
```

You can find the major number in `dmesg` or with:

```bash
cat /proc/devices
```

---

## üßπ 5. **Remove the Module (if needed)**

```bash
sudo rmmod 74hct164
```

Check `dmesg` again to see cleanup logs.

---

Let me know if you want a udev rule to auto-create the `/dev` node or help writing a simple userspace test.
