Yes, it's absolutely possible to write a **Linux kernel-space driver** to communicate with an **FT232 USB-to-Serial** interface for low-latency, high-speed communication with an **Arduino Nano**, especially on a **real-time (RT) patched kernel**. However, there are some deep details and hardware constraints that need to be fully understood before diving in.

---

## ‚úÖ Feasibility: Yes, with caveats

The FT232 is a **USB-to-Serial bridge** chip made by FTDI. It normally communicates using a **standard USB CDC ACM or vendor-specific protocol**, and the FTDI Linux kernel module (`ftdi_sio`) already supports it in user-space through `/dev/ttyUSB*`. But you want:

* **Low latency**, ideally under **1 ms** (to match a 1 kHz schedule).
* **High throughput**, within the limits of USB 2.0 full speed (12 Mbps), and the FT232‚Äôs 4-byte latency timer buffer.
* **Kernel-space access** to avoid user-space scheduling delays.
* **Interrupt-driven** or **event-based** handling.
* **Custom frame parsing**, likely with tight timing constraints.

## üß† Technical Challenges and Options

### 1. **FT232 is a USB device**

So you‚Äôre dealing with USB bulk endpoints, not a traditional serial UART. This means your driver needs to:

* Use the **USB core APIs in kernel space**.
* Handle **URB (USB Request Block)** submissions and completions.
* Carefully manage the **latency timer** (FT232 allows setting it down to **1 ms** or even **off** in some cases).

### 2. **Driver Type**

There are two main approaches:

#### üîß Option A: **Custom kernel-space USB driver**

* Write a new `usb_driver` matching FT232's VID\:PID.
* Bypass `ftdi_sio` completely.
* Submit **URBs** manually to IN/OUT bulk endpoints.
* Implement RX/TX buffering, framing, timing.
* Can handle custom protocols defined by your Arduino firmware.

#### üß© Option B: **Extend/patch `ftdi_sio`**

* Patch the existing FTDI kernel module.
* Add a custom `ioctl` or `sysfs` interface to control behavior.
* Not fully kernel-space, but easier and still low-latency.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Concepts

Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôd do in a **custom FT232 USB kernel driver**:

### 1. **Detect Device**

```c
static const struct usb_device_id ft232_table[] = {
    { USB_DEVICE(0x0403, 0x6001) }, // FT232R VID/PID
    {} 
};
```

### 2. **Allocate Buffers & Submit URBs**

Set up `usb_alloc_urb`, then submit with `usb_submit_urb`. For every 1ms tick from Arduino:

* Arduino sends 4-byte message.
* FT232 sends it over USB.
* USB driver gets an interrupt on URB completion.
* Your callback (`urb->complete`) is called.
* You process the frame and optionally reply via OUT URB.

### 3. **Real-time Scheduling**

* Use **RT kernel** for proper IRQ/thread prioritization.
* Pin USB IRQs and your driver's processing threads to isolated CPU cores.
* Use `hrtimer` or `tasklet` to avoid high-latency kernel threads.

### 4. **Avoid Latency**

* Configure FTDI **latency timer** to 1ms using vendor-specific USB control message (`FTDI_SIO_SET_LATENCY_TIMER`).
* Disable unnecessary buffering (`SET_FLOW_CTRL`, `SET_EVENT_CHAR`).
* If allowed by the chip, **lower the USB polling interval**.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

* **FT232 latency is not sub-1ms guaranteed** due to USB FS limits (1ms polling interval).
* USB **bulk transfer** is not *truly real-time* even with RT kernel.
* You may need to *use FTDI's proprietary protocol*, which is partially reverse engineered.
* The best performance is often achieved using **native SPI/I2C** or **parallel GPIO** rather than USB serial.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendation

If the FT232 is **required**, here‚Äôs what I suggest:

### Minimal Option:

* Patch `ftdi_sio` to optimize latency (1ms timer, large URB pool).
* Use `select()` or `epoll()` in user-space with `SCHED_FIFO`.

### Advanced Option:

* Write a **custom kernel USB driver**:

  * Handles USB endpoints directly.
  * Communicates with Arduino on a tight 1kHz loop.
  * Uses custom framing protocol.

If you're interested, I can sketch out a basic kernel driver skeleton for the FT232 (like a proof of concept). Would you like that?
