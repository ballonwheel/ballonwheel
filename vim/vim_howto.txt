gdb
To use GDB (GNU Debugger) within Vim, you can take advantage of the built-in terminal emulator in Vim. Here's a step-by-step guide:
1. **Open Vim**: Open Vim as you normally would.
2. **Enter Terminal Mode**: Press `Ctrl + W` followed by `:term` to open a terminal window within Vim.
3. **Run GDB**: In the terminal window, type `gdb` followed by the name of the executable you want to debug. For example:
   ```
   gdb ./my_program
  ```
4. **Use GDB**: You can now use GDB commands as you would in a regular terminal. Set breakpoints, run your program, examine variables, etc.
5. **Navigate between Vim and GDB**: You can switch between Vim and the terminal window by pressing `Ctrl + W` twice. This allows you to edit your code in Vim and then switch back to the terminal to interact with GDB.
6. **Exit GDB**: When you're done debugging, you can exit GDB by typing `quit` in the terminal window.
This approach allows you to seamlessly integrate GDB into your Vim workflow, enabling you to edit your code and debug it without leaving the Vim environment.
