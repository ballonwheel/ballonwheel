This will drop you into a shell session where you can execute commands. To return to Vim from the shell, simply type exit and press Enter.




gdb
To use GDB (GNU Debugger) within Vim, you can take advantage of the built-in terminal emulator in Vim. Here's a step-by-step guide:
1. **Open Vim**: Open Vim as you normally would.
2. **Enter Terminal Mode**: Press `Ctrl + W` followed by `:term` to open a terminal window within Vim.
3. **Run GDB**: In the terminal window, type `gdb` followed by the name of the executable you want to debug. For example:
   ```
   gdb ./my_program
  ```
4. **Use GDB**: You can now use GDB commands as you would in a regular terminal. Set breakpoints, run your program, examine variables, etc.
5. **Navigate between Vim and GDB**: You can switch between Vim and the terminal window by pressing `Ctrl + W` twice. This allows you to edit your code in Vim and then switch back to the terminal to interact with GDB.
6. **Exit GDB**: When you're done debugging, you can exit GDB by typing `quit` in the terminal window.
This approach allows you to seamlessly integrate GDB into your Vim workflow, enabling you to edit your code and debug it without leaving the Vim environment.
