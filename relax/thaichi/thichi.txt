The 48-form Tai Chi Chuan, also known as the "Combined 48 Forms Tai Chi" or "Beijing 48 Form," is a modern form of Tai Chi that was created in the 1970s by the Chinese National Sports Committee. It was developed by combining movements from the traditional Yang, Wu, Chen, and Sun styles of Tai Chi. The form consists of 48 movements performed in a continuous sequence. Each movement flows smoothly into the next, promoting balance, coordination, and relaxation.
