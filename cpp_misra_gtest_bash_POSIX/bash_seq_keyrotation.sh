debian , bash, for security reason i am thinking of automatic ssh key changes...
so that keys are generated (example 100 pieces? how much space? which strong key is worth?)and stored in a kind of database 
(also at client, shared before); so the keys are automatically changed in every day 
(maybe an email is sent with message of the number of the day(guessing which kay shall be used)...what do you think?




This is a **very interesting security idea**, and it *can* increase resilience against key compromise ‚Äî but also introduces complexity and potential pitfalls.

Let's break it down and analyze **security, feasibility, alternatives, and implementation advice**.

---

## üîê IDEA SUMMARY

You want:

* To generate e.g. **100 SSH key pairs** (pre-shared between client and server),
* Store them in a local and remote **secure ‚Äúkey database‚Äù**,
* Use **one key per day**, rotated automatically (e.g., Day 37 ‚Üí Key 37),
* Optionally send an **email with the day's key ID** to inform which one to use.

---

## ‚úÖ PROS

* ‚úÖ If a key is compromised, future keys remain secure (forward secrecy-like behavior).
* ‚úÖ Daily rotation limits the exposure window.
* ‚úÖ Doesn‚Äôt depend on central key distribution (since keys are pre-shared).
* ‚úÖ Easier revocation ‚Äî just skip/delete compromised key entry.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISKS & CHALLENGES

1. **Key Management Complexity**

   * You need exact synchronization of client/server over time.
   * Requires logic to manage fallback (e.g., if Day 42 fails, try 41/40...?)

2. **Key Theft Timing**

   * If one key is stolen before usage day, it could be used that day.
   * Might need additional checks (e.g., 2FA or logs).

3. **Storage Security**

   * The database of keys must be stored encrypted.
   * If an attacker gets the whole set, you‚Äôve lost the main advantage.

4. **Email Risks**

   * Emailing the key index could leak info to adversaries.

5. **Standard Tool Limitations**

   * OpenSSH doesn't natively support rotating keys by date.
   * You'd need a wrapper around SSH or a PAM plugin/script.

## üîê SSH KEY SPECS & STORAGE COST

| Type    | Size | Security       | Private Key Size | Public Key Size |
| ------- | ---- | -------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| RSA     | 4096 | High           | \~3.2 KB         | \~750 B         |
| ECDSA   | 521  | Good           | \~250 B          | \~150 B         |
| Ed25519 | N/A  | Excellent+fast | \~464 B          | \~128 B         |

**100 Ed25519 keys total**:

* \~50 KB total for both public + private.

Ed25519 is modern, secure, and recommended unless you need legacy compatibility.

## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (Sketch)

### Step 1: Generate Keys

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh/keys
for i in {1..100}; do
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/keys/id_ed25519_$i -N ""
done
```

### Step 2: Sync Public Keys to Server

Each public key can be placed in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` with a **comment**:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/keys/id_ed25519_1.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Or keep them in a **key file per day**, like `/etc/ssh/daykeys/37.pub`.

### Step 3: Daily Rotation Script

On client:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
KEY_NUM=$(date +%j) # 001 to 365
KEY_PATH="$HOME/.ssh/keys/id_ed25519_${KEY_NUM}"

# Optional: send email to inform which key to use
echo "Use key number $KEY_NUM today" | mail -s "SSH key of the day" you@example.com

# Set this as default identity
cp "$KEY_PATH" ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

On server:

* Use a **custom script or cron job** to allow only today's public key.
* Option: generate daily `/etc/ssh/authorized_keys` from the 100 stored keys.

---

## üîê ALTERNATIVES WORTH CONSIDERING

### üß† Simpler & Secure: **SSH Certificate Authorities**

* Generate a *new key every day*,
* Sign it with an internal SSH CA,
* Server trusts the CA, not individual keys,
* Rotation becomes easy and scalable,
* Tools: `ssh-keygen -s` and `TrustedUserCAKeys` in `sshd_config`.

**Benefit**: Only the CA public key is known to the server. You can rotate or revoke keys easily without syncing key databases.

### üß± Or: Use mTLS or VPN + SSH

* Use TLS client certificates for stronger auth control.
* Or OpenVPN/WireGuard to isolate SSH behind a private net.

---

## üß© Final Recommendation

Your rotating-key plan is feasible for small, controlled environments ‚Äî great for *learning, experimentation, or high-paranoia use cases* ‚Äî but for production, consider:

* **Ed25519 for key strength**
* **GPG or hardware tokens** for secure storage
* **OpenSSH CA model** for scalability + security

Would you like a full Bash script package to manage this key rotation?
