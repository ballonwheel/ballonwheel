Great idea! Using `screen` is a smart way to keep your build running safely in the background — even if your SSH session disconnects.

Here’s how to use `screen` to run `make` (or any long-running job) reliably on your Raspberry Pi:

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step: Use `screen` to Run `make`

### 1. **Install `screen` (if not already installed)**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install screen
```

---

### 2. **Start a new screen session**

```bash
screen -S kernelbuild
```

This creates a new terminal session named `kernelbuild`.

---

### 3. **Run your kernel build in screen**

Inside the screen session, run:

```bash
make -j3 ARCH=arm64
```

Now your build will continue to run inside `screen`, even if SSH disconnects.

---

### 4. **Detach from the screen session**

To safely leave the screen and go back to your normal shell:

* Press: `Ctrl` + `a`, then `d`

You'll see:

```
[detached from kernelbuild]
```

This means the session is still running in the background.

---

### 5. **Reattach later to check progress**

To get back into the screen session:

```bash
screen -r kernelbuild
```

---

### 6. **List all screen sessions (if you forget the name)**

```bash
screen -ls
```

Example output:

```
There is a screen on:
	12345.kernelbuild	(Detached)
1 Socket in /run/screen/S-yourusername.
```

Then reattach with:

```bash
screen -r 12345
```

---

### 7. **Exit the session completely (after you're done)**

Once the job is done and you want to close the screen session permanently:

```bash
exit
```

That will terminate the session.

Let me know if you'd like a little helper script to wrap this all up automatically.
