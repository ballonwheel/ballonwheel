debian bash script 1, scan all running program and daemons and put in log. 2, examine log to look for suspcious record (maleware)  


Here is a **Debian-compatible Bash script** that performs the following:

1. **Scans all running programs and daemons** and logs their information.
2. **Examines the log for suspicious entries** (e.g., common malware indicators).

---

### 🔧 Script: `scan_processes.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

LOG_DIR="/var/log/process_scan"
LOG_FILE="$LOG_DIR/scan_$(date +%F_%T).log"
SUSPICIOUS_LOG="$LOG_DIR/suspicious_$(date +%F_%T).log"

mkdir -p "$LOG_DIR"

echo "[*] Scanning running processes and daemons..."
echo "Scan started at: $(date)" > "$LOG_FILE"
ps auxfww >> "$LOG_FILE"
echo -e "\nList of loaded daemons (systemd):" >> "$LOG_FILE"
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running >> "$LOG_FILE"

echo "[*] Searching for suspicious entries..."
# Define some simple suspicious keywords (can be extended)
SUSPICIOUS_KEYWORDS=("cryptominer" "bitcoin" "botnet" "minerd" "malware" "suspicious" "trojan" "backdoor" "/tmp" "/dev/shm" "nc " "wget " "curl ")

touch "$SUSPICIOUS_LOG"
echo "Suspicious entries found at $(date):" > "$SUSPICIOUS_LOG"

for keyword in "${SUSPICIOUS_KEYWORDS[@]}"; do
    grep -i "$keyword" "$LOG_FILE" >> "$SUSPICIOUS_LOG"
done

# Show results
if [[ -s "$SUSPICIOUS_LOG" ]]; then
    echo "[!] Suspicious activity detected. See: $SUSPICIOUS_LOG"
else
    echo "[✓] No suspicious activity found."
    rm "$SUSPICIOUS_LOG"
fi

echo "Full scan log saved at: $LOG_FILE"
```

---

### ✅ How to Use

1. Save the script as `scan_processes.sh`
2. Make it executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x scan_processes.sh
   ```
3. Run with root or sudo:

   ```bash
   sudo ./scan_processes.sh
   ```

---

### 🔒 Notes

* This script does **basic** keyword-based detection.
* For **stronger detection**, consider using tools like:

  * [`chkrootkit`](https://www.chkrootkit.org/)
  * [`rkhunter`](https://rkhunter.sourceforge.net/)
  * [`lynis`](https://cisofy.com/lynis/)
  * Or integrate with `ClamAV` for scanning malicious binaries.

Would you like to extend this to automatically kill or isolate suspicious processes?





***********************************

debian bash, can we detect that my system doing a mass of site attach, 
bec. probably that is totally unwanted from my side, so that my system is hacked....so creating a fuse for interrupt such behav.



Yes, you **can and should** monitor for suspicious outgoing traffic patterns — especially mass site requests (potential DDoS or botnet behavior) — which are strong signs of compromise. Below is a **Bash-based monitoring and "fuse" system** idea for Debian:

---

### 🛡️ GOAL:

* Detect high volume of **outgoing connections**.
* Identify possible **botnet/malware behavior**.
* Log and **interrupt network activity** (e.g., disable internet or alert you).

---

## ✅ STEP 1: Basic Outgoing Connection Monitor (netstat/lsof/ss)

Create a script to check outgoing connections per process.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# threshold for suspicious behavior
MAX_CONN=100
LOGFILE="/var/log/suspicious_activity.log"
DATE=$(date)

# list processes with many connections
suspects=$(ss -tunp | grep -v '127.0.0.1' | awk '{print $7}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk -v max=$MAX_CONN '$1 > max')

if [[ ! -z "$suspects" ]]; then
    echo "[$DATE] Suspicious activity detected:" >> "$LOGFILE"
    echo "$suspects" >> "$LOGFILE"
    
    echo "Killing suspicious processes..."
    echo "$suspects" | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/[^0-9]*//g' | xargs -r kill -9
fi
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/netfuse.sh
```

Add to cron or systemd to run periodically:

```bash
*/5 * * * * root /usr/local/bin/netfuse.sh
```

---

## ✅ STEP 2: Alternative (iftop/tcpdump Monitoring)

You can use tools like `iftop`, `tcpdump`, or `nethogs` for more precise bandwidth and domain-level monitoring. Here's an example using `iftop` in CLI mode:

```bash
sudo apt install iftop
sudo iftop -i eth0 -t -s 60  # Monitor eth0 for 60 seconds
```

---

## ✅ STEP 3: Cut Internet on Detection

You can add a "fuse" to disable network interfaces or drop outgoing traffic:

```bash
# Disable all internet (IPv4)
iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
# Or disable just suspicious domain IPs
iptables -A OUTPUT -d <IP> -j DROP
```

Or disable the interface entirely:

```bash
ip link set eth0 down
```

---

## ✅ STEP 4: Alert via Email (Optional)

Combine with `mailx` or `msmtp`:

```bash
echo "Suspicious traffic detected!" | mail -s "ALERT from $(hostname)" you@example.com
```

---

## ✅ STEP 5: Preventive Ideas

* Harden SSH (`fail2ban`, disable password login).
* Install a host-based IDS like `AIDE` or `OSSEC`.
* Run `rkhunter` or `chkrootkit` periodically.
* Use `ufw` to block outgoing by default, whitelist only needed ports.

---

If you want, I can tailor this for your Raspberry Pi or add real-time detection via `iptables LOG` and `fail2ban`. Want that?
