To make `ping` **not return any response** (suppress all output, including errors) in a Debian Bash script or terminal, you can redirect its output and error streams to `/dev/null`.

### Example: Suppress all ping output

```bash
ping -c 1 8.8.8.8 > /dev/null 2>&1
```

### Explanation:

* `-c 1` ‚Üí Send only one ping packet.
* `> /dev/null` ‚Üí Discards standard output (stdout).
* `2>&1` ‚Üí Redirects standard error (stderr) to stdout, which is already discarded.

This way, the `ping` command will not print anything ‚Äî no success, no failure, no error ‚Äî completely silent.

---

### If you want to also **prevent response (answer) packets from being received** (like firewall-style behavior), that's a different matter:

* On **your machine**, you can block incoming ping replies using `iptables` or `nftables`.
* Example with `iptables`:

  ```bash
  sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-reply -j DROP
  ```
* Example with `nftables`:

  ```bash
  sudo nft add rule inet filter input icmp type echo-reply drop
  ```

Let me know if you're trying to **send ping without responses**, **ignore them**, or **block them system-wide** ‚Äî I‚Äôll tailor the solution.



***********************


Ah, thank you for the clarification.

To **prevent your Debian system from receiving ping replies (ICMP echo replies)** ‚Äî so it seems as though no one is answering your ping ‚Äî you need to **block incoming ICMP echo-reply packets** using a firewall.

Here‚Äôs how to do that using `iptables` or `nftables`:

---

## üî• Option 1: Using `iptables`

To drop **only ICMP echo replies**:

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-reply -j DROP
```

### To make it permanent:

On Debian, install `iptables-persistent` to save the rules:

```bash
sudo apt install iptables-persistent
sudo sh -c 'iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4'
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Option 2: Using `nftables` (preferred on newer Debian)

1. Edit your ruleset:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nftables.conf
```

2. Add a rule like this in the `input` chain:

```nft
table inet filter {
  chain input {
    type filter hook input priority 0;

    # Drop incoming ping replies
    ip protocol icmp icmp type echo-reply drop
    ip6 nexthdr icmpv6 icmpv6 type echo-reply drop

    # ... other rules ...
  }
}
```

3. Reload rules:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nftables
```

---

### ‚úÖ Test It

Try pinging something:

```bash
ping -c 3 8.8.8.8
```

You should see **no replies** (just timeouts), even though your system is still **sending** the ping packets.

---

Would you like to block **all ICMP** (including ping requests), or only stop **replies**?



*******************
what is ICMP? 

### üåê What is ICMP?

**ICMP** stands for **Internet Control Message Protocol**.

It is a core protocol of the Internet Protocol Suite (like TCP and UDP), but it's used **not for sending user data**, but for **diagnostics and control messages** between devices on a network.

---

### üß∞ What Is ICMP Used For?

Some common uses of ICMP include:

| ICMP Type                 | Purpose                                   | Example Command |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `Echo Request`            | Sent to check if a host is reachable      | `ping`          |
| `Echo Reply`              | Sent in response to a ping                |                 |
| `Destination Unreachable` | Sent when a host or port can‚Äôt be reached | Automatic       |
| `Time Exceeded`           | Used in `traceroute` to trace hops        | `traceroute`    |
| `Redirect`                | Tells hosts to use a different gateway    | Rare            |

---

### üõë Why Would You Block ICMP?

* üîí **Security**: Blocking ICMP can hide your device from simple scans (like `ping` sweeps).
* üïµÔ∏è **Stealth**: You might want your server or Pi to appear offline (not reply to ping).
* üß™ **Testing**: To simulate network problems or dropped packets.

But be careful: **blocking all ICMP** can break important functions like:

* Path MTU discovery (used to determine max packet size)
* `traceroute`
* Some VPNs and IPv6 setups

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Block Level       | Effect                                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Only `echo-reply` | Your pings seem to fail (but system works fine) |
| All ICMP          | Full ICMP silence; may cause network issues     |

---

Would you like to:

* ‚úÖ Only stop ping replies (stealthy)?
* üîí Block all ICMP completely (maximum silence)?
* üß™ Customize it per type?

Let me know, and I‚Äôll give you the exact command or config!


*****************************
there is a certain program, (as i remember imap or something like that) which can scan the LAN for all ip and all opened port....
can i hide away from that? 




Yes ‚Äî you're thinking of tools like:

### üîç Common Network Scanners:

| Tool                 | Description                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **nmap**             | Scans IPs and open ports across the network |
| **netdiscover**      | Discovers hosts in LAN using ARP            |
| **angry IP scanner** | Simple GUI-based LAN scanner                |

These tools **don‚Äôt need ICMP (ping)** to find you ‚Äî they can also use:

* **ARP** to find your IP and MAC address (Layer 2)
* **TCP/UDP scanning** to check if any ports respond
* **Service detection** to identify running services (like SSH, HTTP)

---

## üïµÔ∏è Can You Hide From These Scanners?

Yes ‚Äî but not *completely* without physically disconnecting. Here's how to **minimize visibility**:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. **Disable ICMP (ping replies)**

‚úÖ Already covered above ‚Äî helps avoid ping sweeps.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. **Use a Host Firewall**

Use `iptables`, `nftables`, or `ufw` to:

* Drop **all unsolicited inbound traffic**
* Allow only what you use (e.g., SSH from known IP)

Example with `iptables`:

```bash
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
# Optional: allow SSH only from trusted IP
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -s 192.168.1.100 -j ACCEPT
```

---

### ‚úÖ 3. **Avoid ARP Discovery**

This is harder ‚Äî ARP scanning tools like `netdiscover` or `arp-scan` can detect any device *connected* to the LAN, even if all ports are closed.

üîê Option:

* Use a **separate VLAN or subnet**
* Or connect through **WiFi in client-isolation mode** (on some routers)

---

### ‚úÖ 4. **Don‚Äôt Run Open Ports**

If your device isn‚Äôt listening on any port, `nmap` will find nothing to connect to. Check what's open:

```bash
sudo ss -tuln
```

Close or firewall all unused services.

---

### ‚úÖ 5. **Use a Stealthy OS**

* Hardened Linux systems (e.g., Tails, Qubes, Alpine)
* No broadcast, no discovery services
* No hostname advertising

---

### üö® Remember:

Even with everything blocked, a connected device still has a MAC address and IP visible via ARP. So **perfect invisibility isn't possible**, but you can make scanning results look like:

```
Host is up (no response to ping).
All 1000 scanned ports on 192.168.1.X are filtered.
```

Which is usually enough to "disappear" to most tools.

Would you like a script or `iptables/nftables` config to fully lock down your Raspberry Pi or Debian device?



*************************



opwnwrt on a raspberry pi hw is able to do that?



Yes, **OpenWrt on a Raspberry Pi** is absolutely capable of doing that ‚Äî including **Wi-Fi client isolation**, firewalling, and network segmentation ‚Äî with **much more control** than a typical home router.

---

## üß± What Is Client Isolation?

**Client isolation** means:

* Devices **connected to the same Wi-Fi** (e.g., your phone and laptop) **can‚Äôt see or talk to each other**.
* Only communication with the **gateway/router** (internet) is allowed.

Perfect for:

* Hiding IoT devices from each other
* Preventing LAN scans or man-in-the-middle attacks
* Creating a ‚Äúguest‚Äù or ‚Äúuntrusted‚Äù network

---

## ‚úÖ Yes, OpenWrt on Raspberry Pi Can Do This

If your Raspberry Pi is running OpenWrt and has a supported Wi-Fi adapter (like a USB dongle with AP mode), then you can enable **client isolation**:

### 1. **Enable Isolation in Wi-Fi Config**

Edit `/etc/config/wireless`:

```bash
config wifi-iface
    option device 'radio0'
    option mode 'ap'
    option network 'lan'
    option ssid 'HiddenLAN'
    option encryption 'psk2'
    option key 'yourpassword'
    option isolate '1'   # <--- this is the key line
```

Then reload Wi-Fi:

```bash
wifi reload
```

### 2. (Optional) VLANs or Guest Network

You can go further by:

* Assigning isolated clients to a different **VLAN**
* Creating a **guest** network interface with **firewall zones**
* Blocking all inter-client and LAN access with `iptables` or `nftables`

---

### üîå Supported Raspberry Pi Boards

OpenWrt works well on:

* **Raspberry Pi 3/3B+**
* **Raspberry Pi 4**
* **Pi Zero 2 W** (limited by single core and USB speed)

However, the built-in Wi-Fi on Raspberry Pi **may not support full AP mode features** like client isolation. In that case:

üîå **Use a supported USB Wi-Fi adapter**, such as:

* Atheros AR9271 (TL-WN722N v1)
* MT7601U or MT7612U
* Ralink RT5370

Check OpenWrt's [Table of Hardware](https://openwrt.org/toh/start) for compatibility.

### üß† Summary

| Feature                         | OpenWrt on Raspberry Pi           |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Client Isolation (Wi-Fi)        | ‚úÖ Yes (with `option isolate '1'`) |
