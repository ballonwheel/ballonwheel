what if i do not use wireguard, vpn; only using ssh(with asym keys aes256), open a port on router for remote? from security point of view is that s wrong?




You're absolutely **not wrong** — using **SSH with strong asymmetric keys and AES-256 encryption**, exposed on a router port for remote access, is a **legitimate and secure option** if configured correctly.

In fact, SSH is often **simpler, lighter, and more mature** than VPNs for many use cases — and when hardened, it's very secure.

## 🔐 From a Security Perspective: Is SSH via Port Forwarding Secure?

**Yes — if you do it right.**

---

## ✅ What Makes SSH Secure?

| Security Layer        | Recommended Practice                                     |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔑 **Authentication** | Use **only key-based auth** (disable passwords)          |
| 🔒 **Encryption**     | AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20 available, auto-negotiated       |
| 🚪 **Port exposure**  | OK if protected (e.g., not default 22, fail2ban enabled) |
| 📜 **Hardening**      | Disable root login, limit users, use `AllowUsers`, etc.  |
| 🛡️ **Defense**       | Use firewall, IP rate-limiting, optional port knocking   |

---

## 🛠️ Secure SSH Server Configuration (Checklist)

In `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```ini
Port 2222                   # Change default port (optional)
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
AllowUsers youruser
PubkeyAuthentication yes
Protocol 2
PermitEmptyPasswords no
MaxAuthTries 3
ClientAliveInterval 300
ClientAliveCountMax 2
```

Then:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

---

## 🔁 SSH Key Encryption

Your SSH keys are **RSA, ECDSA, or Ed25519** for authentication, and the session itself is encrypted using **AES-256-GCM**, **ChaCha20-Poly1305**, etc., depending on negotiation.

You can inspect algorithms:

```bash
ssh -Q cipher
```

Example ciphers:

* `aes256-gcm@openssh.com` ✅ (AES-256)
* `chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com` ✅ (ChaCha20)
* `aes256-ctr` ✅

## 🧱 How Does This Compare to VPNs (e.g., WireGuard)?

| Feature                    | SSH                           | VPN (e.g. WireGuard)           |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Port exposure              | ✅ Single port (e.g. 2222)     | ✅ Usually 51820/UDP            |
| Protocol maturity          | ✅ 25+ years                   | ✅ Newer but proven (WireGuard) |
| Encryption strength        | ✅ AES-256 or ChaCha20         | ✅ ChaCha20                     |
| Complexity                 | ⚡ Simpler                     | 🧩 More moving parts           |
| Tunnel whole traffic       | ❌ Not by default              | ✅ Yes                          |
| SOCKS proxy / port forward | ✅ Built-in (dynamic or local) | ❌ Not built-in                 |
| Multi-peer networking      | ❌ One-to-one, manual          | ✅ Mesh & multi-peer easier     |

---

## 🧰 Bonus: Using SSH as a Poor Man’s VPN

You can tunnel traffic via SOCKS proxy:

```bash
ssh -D 1080 -C -N -p 2222 youruser@your.remote.ip
```

Then configure your browser to use **localhost:1080 SOCKS5**. This gives **encrypted, per-app VPN-like traffic** — no extra tools.

---

## ⚠️ What to Watch For

1. **Don't leave password login enabled** — attackers scan for that.
2. **Monitor with fail2ban** — auto-bans brute-force IPs.
3. **Use a firewall** (e.g., `ufw`, `iptables`) to restrict allowed IPs.
4. **Keep SSH updated** — always patch.
5. **Audit logs** — check `/var/log/auth.log` regularly.

---

## ✅ Bottom Line

| Question                             | Answer                       |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Is SSH secure if exposed via router? | ✅ Yes, if hardened           |
| Do you need VPN in this case?        | ❌ Not necessarily            |
| Is SSH + port forward a valid model? | ✅ Especially for light usage |

So: **Your approach is valid and secure** for most private or even semi-professional uses — *if hardened properly*.
