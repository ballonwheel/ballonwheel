using sha256, shall i switch?


Yes, if you're using an **older SSH key type (like RSA)** with SHA-256 fingerprint, it may be **acceptable but not optimal** by today’s security standards.

Here’s what you should consider:

---

### ✅ **If your current key is:**

#### 🔸 `ssh-rsa` (SHA-256 fingerprint)

* RSA keys are still supported, **but**:

  * They rely on key size for security (2048-bit or 4096-bit recommended).
  * SSH servers are **phasing out SHA-1 signed RSA keys** (`ssh-rsa` in older OpenSSH).
  * SHA-256 is just the fingerprinting algorithm — your **key is still RSA**.

🔹 **Should you switch?**

* **Yes**, it's a good idea to **switch to Ed25519** or **ECDSA**, unless you have a compatibility constraint.

---

### 🔒 **Recommended modern key types:**

#### 🔹 `ssh-ed25519`

* ✅ Fast, strong, compact (68-byte keys).
* ✅ Secure and **widely supported** (OpenSSH ≥6.5).
* ✅ Default recommendation in 2025.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

#### 🔹 `ecdsa` (Elliptic Curve DSA)

* Shorter than RSA, but **not as widely preferred** as Ed25519.
* Avoid using curves smaller than 256-bit.

---

### 🛠️ **How to switch safely:**

1. Generate a new key:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
2. Copy the public key to your remote systems:

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub user@host
   ```
3. Test login works:

   ```bash
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 user@host
   ```
4. (Optional) Remove the old RSA key from `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote side.

*******************************
i would like to switch ed25519 but i can reach the rasp pi server from remote, pls advise me steps



Great! Since your **Raspberry Pi is remote** and you want to **switch from RSA to Ed25519 SSH key authentication**, the key is **not to lose access** during the transition.

Here’s a **safe step-by-step guide**:

---

### ✅ **Step 1: Generate your new Ed25519 key on your local machine**

On your **local machine (not the Pi)**:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "imre@yourmachine"
```

* Save as: `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
* You may leave the passphrase empty (or add one for extra security)

---

### ✅ **Step 2: Upload new key to the Raspberry Pi**

Still on your local machine, **add the new key** to the Raspberry Pi *without removing the old RSA key yet*:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub pi@your.rpi.ip.address
```

> Replace `pi` and IP with your real SSH username and address. This appends the new Ed25519 key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the Pi.

---

### ✅ **Step 3: Test the new key works**

Before touching anything else, **test if you can log in using only the Ed25519 key**:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 pi@your.rpi.ip.address
```

If it works, you're good to proceed. If it fails, **don’t change anything yet**.

---

### ✅ **Step 4: Configure SSH to prefer the new key**

On your local machine, edit (or create) your SSH config:

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

Add this block:

```ini
Host mypi
    HostName your.rpi.ip.address
    User pi
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Now you can connect with:

```bash
ssh mypi
```

---

### ✅ **Step 5: Remove the old RSA key from Raspberry Pi (optional)**

After confirming everything works with Ed25519, SSH into the Pi and remove the old RSA key from `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

On the Pi:

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

* Delete the line that starts with `ssh-rsa`
* Leave the `ssh-ed25519` line

---

### ✅ **Optional: Harden the Pi to accept only Ed25519**

On the Raspberry Pi:

1. Edit the SSH daemon config:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

2. Add or update these lines:

```conf
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication no
AuthenticationMethods publickey
```

3. Restart the SSH server:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

| ------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Generate Ed25519 key                  | Local     | `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`              |
| Copy key to Pi                        | Local     | `ssh-copy-id -i id_ed25519.pub`      |
| Test login                            | Local     | `ssh -i id_ed25519 user@pi`          |
| Remove RSA key                        | Pi        | Edit `authorized_keys` after testing |
| (Optional) Disable RSA/password login | Pi        | Only after full testing              |

Let me know if you want to automate any of this with a script.
