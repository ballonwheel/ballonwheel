what if i do not use wireguard, vpn; only using ssh(with asym keys aes256), 
open a port on router for remote? from security point of view is that s wrong?




You're absolutely **not wrong** ‚Äî using **SSH with strong asymmetric keys and AES-256 encryption**, exposed on a router port for remote access, is a **legitimate and secure option** if configured correctly.

In fact, SSH is often **simpler, lighter, and more mature** than VPNs for many use cases ‚Äî and when hardened, it's very secure.

## üîê From a Security Perspective: Is SSH via Port Forwarding Secure?

**Yes ‚Äî if you do it right.**

---

## ‚úÖ What Makes SSH Secure?

| Security Layer        | Recommended Practice                                     |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| üîë **Authentication** | Use **only key-based auth** (disable passwords)          |
| üîí **Encryption**     | AES-256-GCM or ChaCha20 available, auto-negotiated       |
| üö™ **Port exposure**  | OK if protected (e.g., not default 22, fail2ban enabled) |
| üìú **Hardening**      | Disable root login, limit users, use `AllowUsers`, etc.  |
| üõ°Ô∏è **Defense**       | Use firewall, IP rate-limiting, optional port knocking   |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Secure SSH Server Configuration (Checklist)

In `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```ini
Port 2222                   # Change default port (optional)
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
AllowUsers youruser
PubkeyAuthentication yes
Protocol 2
PermitEmptyPasswords no
MaxAuthTries 3
ClientAliveInterval 300
ClientAliveCountMax 2
```

Then:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

---

## üîÅ SSH Key Encryption

Your SSH keys are **RSA, ECDSA, or Ed25519** for authentication, and the session itself is encrypted using **AES-256-GCM**, **ChaCha20-Poly1305**, etc., depending on negotiation.

You can inspect algorithms:

```bash
ssh -Q cipher
```

Example ciphers:

* `aes256-gcm@openssh.com` ‚úÖ (AES-256)
* `chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com` ‚úÖ (ChaCha20)
* `aes256-ctr` ‚úÖ

## üß± How Does This Compare to VPNs (e.g., WireGuard)?

| Feature                    | SSH                           | VPN (e.g. WireGuard)           |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Port exposure              | ‚úÖ Single port (e.g. 2222)     | ‚úÖ Usually 51820/UDP            |
| Protocol maturity          | ‚úÖ 25+ years                   | ‚úÖ Newer but proven (WireGuard) |
| Encryption strength        | ‚úÖ AES-256 or ChaCha20         | ‚úÖ ChaCha20                     |
| Complexity                 | ‚ö° Simpler                     | üß© More moving parts           |
| Tunnel whole traffic       | ‚ùå Not by default              | ‚úÖ Yes                          |
| SOCKS proxy / port forward | ‚úÖ Built-in (dynamic or local) | ‚ùå Not built-in                 |
| Multi-peer networking      | ‚ùå One-to-one, manual          | ‚úÖ Mesh & multi-peer easier     |

---

## üß∞ Bonus: Using SSH as a Poor Man‚Äôs VPN

You can tunnel traffic via SOCKS proxy:

```bash
ssh -D 1080 -C -N -p 2222 youruser@your.remote.ip
```

Then configure your browser to use **localhost:1080 SOCKS5**. This gives **encrypted, per-app VPN-like traffic** ‚Äî no extra tools.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What to Watch For

1. **Don't leave password login enabled** ‚Äî attackers scan for that.
2. **Monitor with fail2ban** ‚Äî auto-bans brute-force IPs.
3. **Use a firewall** (e.g., `ufw`, `iptables`) to restrict allowed IPs.
4. **Keep SSH updated** ‚Äî always patch.
5. **Audit logs** ‚Äî check `/var/log/auth.log` regularly.

---

## ‚úÖ Bottom Line

| Question                             | Answer                       |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Is SSH secure if exposed via router? | ‚úÖ Yes, if hardened           |
| Do you need VPN in this case?        | ‚ùå Not necessarily            |
| Is SSH + port forward a valid model? | ‚úÖ Especially for light usage |

So: **Your approach is valid and secure** for most private or even semi-professional uses ‚Äî *if hardened properly*.

Would you like a script that sets up a hardened SSH config with custom port, key auth, and optional `fail2ban` setup?


***********************-

sometimes internet provider seems doing wrong, but what..something with NAT (what is it?)...router port forwarding does not work from wan




Ah yes ‚Äî you‚Äôre describing a **common but frustrating situation**: your internet provider uses a type of NAT that **prevents you from receiving direct incoming connections** (like SSH or VPN) even if you set up port forwarding properly on your own router.

Let‚Äôs break it down:

---

## üåê What is NAT?

**NAT = Network Address Translation**

* It‚Äôs used when your ISP assigns **private IP addresses** to you (e.g. 10.x.x.x or 100.x.x.x).
* Your router translates internal IPs (192.168.x.x) to a **single external IP** to reach the internet.

### üîπ Common NAT Types:

| NAT Type                      | Can You Do Port Forwarding? | Description                           |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Public IP                   | **Yes**                     | Real, globally routable IP address    |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Carrier-Grade NAT (CG-NAT) | **No**                      | ISP shares a public IP across users   |
| ‚ùå Double NAT                  | **No (usually)**            | Two routers doing NAT before internet |

---

## üß™ How to Check If You‚Äôre Behind CG-NAT

### üìå Step 1: What‚Äôs your router's WAN IP?

Check your router admin panel (e.g., `192.168.1.1 ‚Üí Status ‚Üí WAN`) ‚Äî is it something like:

* `10.x.x.x`
* `100.64.x.x` (RFC6598)
* `192.168.x.x`

If **yes** ‚Üí you‚Äôre almost certainly behind **CG-NAT or double NAT**.

### üìå Step 2: Compare external IPs

```bash
curl ifconfig.me
```

Compare that to what your router says.

* If different ‚Üí CG-NAT or double NAT
* If same ‚Üí You have a public IP, and port forwarding *should* work

---

## üö´ Why Port Forwarding Fails with CG-NAT

Because **you don‚Äôt control the real public IP** ‚Äî your ISP‚Äôs upstream router does.

* Incoming requests hit **your ISP**, not your router.
* Your port forwarding rules are never even seen.

---

## ‚úÖ What You Can Do About It

### üÖ∞Ô∏è Option 1: Ask ISP for Public IP

> Call or email your ISP and say:
>
> > ‚ÄúPlease assign me a real public IP address (not behind CG-NAT), I need it for remote access / server hosting.‚Äù

Many ISPs will **switch you to a public dynamic IP for free**. Some offer **static IPs for a small monthly fee**.

---

### üÖ±Ô∏è Option 2: Use a VPN with a Public Endpoint

If ISP won‚Äôt give you a public IP:

| Method                        | Description                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **WireGuard with VPS**        | You rent a cheap VPS (e.g., Hetzner, Oracle free tier) with public IP, and use **reverse VPN tunnel** back to your home |
| **SSH Reverse Tunnel**        | From your home device, run: `ssh -R 2222:localhost:22 user@vps` ‚Äî then access your home over VPS                        |
| **Ngrok / Cloudflare Tunnel** | Use services that provide public endpoints for tunneled access                                                          |
| **Tailscale / ZeroTier**      | Mesh VPNs that work behind NAT, no port forwarding needed                                                               |

---

## üß∞ Example: SSH Reverse Tunnel via VPS

On home system (behind NAT):

```bash
ssh -N -R 2222:localhost:22 user@vps.public.ip
```

Then from anywhere:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 user@vps.public.ip
```

This lets you **bypass NAT entirely** by initiating the connection from inside.

| Problem                       | Solution                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| ISP CG-NAT / double NAT       | Request public IP (best fix)                     |
| Port forward not working      | Check router WAN IP; compare to real external IP |
| Need remote access behind NAT | Use reverse tunnel (SSH or WireGuard + VPS)      |
